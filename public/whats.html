    Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
</p>

<p>
    Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined
    by Ted Nelson around 1965 (see History ).
</p>

<p>
    HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be
    text: it can include graphics, video and sound , for example. Apparently
    Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.

<p>
    Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
